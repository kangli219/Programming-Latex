This file provides a fancy template for applied economists to write slides using beamer. 

Here is a list of features of the template:

1. Self-defined beamer theme, fonts, font size, colors, itemize style, table of contents, etc.

2. Adding figures with size adjusted.

3. Adding tables with columns showing up sequentially.

4. Beautiful math with self-defined colors and underbraces.

5. Hyperlinks through beamergotobutton.

6. Taking notes for your slides (not used yet).
